      <p class="centered">This is a living project that will have continual updates.

      You can view the full week-by-week updates for what was completed as part of the MCAD program on my Progress Platform using the link above.</p>
      
      <p>This project was born from a desire to create educational art and design content that will hopefully inspire others to find their own joy in participating in the deeply human activity of creativity.</p>

      <p>
        Many people struggle to pick up a pencil or paint brush because they want to be good at it immediately. Or maybe they feel like they don’t have the time to learn a new skill and they think that whatever they are doing must be perfect on the first try because if it isn’t, then it’s “not worth doing.”
      </p>

      <p>But I’d argue the act of creating is, itself, the purpose of the practice.</p>

        This project has been a work in progress for the entirety of my time in the MCAD MAGWD program, even though I didn't fully realize that at the time. I conducted a wide range of research over the last two years, but some of the most poignent points came from "The Creative Spark" by Agustin Fuentes, professor of anthropology at Princeton University.

      <p>
        With this understanding of the humanity behind creativity, I felt like I was ready to explore how I could help others to learn this information and feel safe to participate in creative activities. 
      </p>

        I proceeded with designing a brand that could be used to package these educational videos I wanted to make. I spent a lot of time developing the brand's tone, color, type, logo, and visual imagery. The complete details of my design process can be found in my <a href="https://app.milanote.com/1TMM1v1PeyMi9w?p=115GF63QJMW">Progress Platform</a>.

      <h2>Project Updates</h2>

      <p>I still have a lot of work to do on this project. While I got a good start during my capstone class, I was far more ambitious in what I wanted to produce than what was realistic. I'm excited to continue to develop this brand and to bring these videos to life!</p>
